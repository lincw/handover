description: Handover system — cross-device, cross-agent, cross-account work continuation. Generate a structured handover note at session end (markdown on Google Drive, SQLite indexed locally) and resume on any machine or agent. When the user says "handover", "hand over", "save progress", "switching devices/accounts", "switching to Gemini", or "that's enough for today", use it to hand over; when they say "take over", "where did I leave off", "continue yesterday's work", "resume", or want context at a new session start, use it to load. Also use for listing or searching past notes (e.g., "what methods have I tried before").

# Handover Notes

Markdown files are the single source of truth (stored on Google Drive, synced across devices); SQLite is just a local index that any script can rebuild. All scripts live in the `scripts/` folder within this skill. Script paths contain spaces—always quote them.

## Handing Over (before session end)

1. **Determine session_type**: `sdd` (design-driven development) / `debug` / `discussion` / `admin`. Ask the user once if unsure.
2. **Write a draft** to a temp directory (e.g., `draft.md`), using the format below.
3. **Save**: `"<skill-dir>/scripts/save.sh" --file draft.md`
4. Report the id and suggest `/clear` to the user (clean context is better than bloated context with rot).

### Draft Format

```markdown
---
project: gmail-billing-scan
session_type: debug
account: personal
test_status: 3 failing in parser_test

# One sentence: what does this note do

## Done
What was accomplished (specific to files and functions).

## Decisions
What decisions were made and why. For discussion sessions, record "argument → consensus/disagreement".

## Blocked
Where you're stuck (omit if none).

## Next steps
Each item must be executable as-is, with file paths. No vague "keep debugging".

## Attempted approaches
Record as "approach → result → why it was ruled out". Mandatory for debug type; most valuable field.

## Lessons learned
Long-term applicable lessons (omit if none).
```

Frontmatter: only fill in `project`, `session_type`, and `account` (if known); other fields (created_at, device, branch, working_dir, status, agent) are auto-filled by save.sh. **Never write tokens, passwords, or credentials**—handover notes get pasted into other agents' prompts.

### Summary Depth by Session Type

- **sdd**: Record progress and "decisions that deviate from design docs". Design details → reference doc paths, don't repeat.
- **debug**: Attempted approaches is the main focus; write liberally. The final solution is secondary.
- **discussion**: Record arguments, consensus, disagreement. Skip the conversation itself.
- **admin**: Just Next steps and Decisions.

### Quality Rules (most handover failures violate these two)

- Write for **someone who never saw this conversation**: avoid pronouns and local shorthand; give full names and paths on first mention.
- Each next step must be actionable without asking the author.

## Taking Over (new session start)

1. `"<skill-dir>/scripts/load.sh" --project <name>` (newest open note; use `--id` for a specific one).
2. **Validate before acting**: the note is a snapshot from when it was written. Check if the branch still exists/merged, if mentioned files have changed; trust current state if there's a mismatch, and tell the user.
3. After starting work, mark the taken-over note: `"<skill-dir>/scripts/mark.sh" <id> superseded` (if you'll save a new note later) or `done` (work is complete). **Stale open notes are more dangerous than no notes.**

### Handing Over to Another Agent (Gemini, etc.)

`load.sh --project <name> --layer1-only` outputs only the generic layer (strips environment metadata from frontmatter). Paste the output directly to the other agent.

## Listing and Searching

- `"<skill-dir>/scripts/list.sh"`: open notes from last 30 days; `--all` shows all; `--project` filters.
- `"<skill-dir>/scripts/search.sh" "keyword"`: FTS5 full-text search—great for "what methods have I tried".

## Boundary with Long-Term Memory

Handover records **state** (expires), memory/CLAUDE.md records **facts and preferences** (long-lived). When taking over, if you find long-term-applicable lessons in Lessons learned, suggest upgrading them to memory; mark the note done.
